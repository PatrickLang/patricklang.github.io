I'm setting up a Jekyll-based blog using this helpful [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for project announcements, pseudo-random musings, and sharing experiences developing projects using Docker.

Worklist:

[ ] set up Jeckyll
[ ] Get a stylesheet, etc
[ ] First post - walkthrough of openelp
[ ] Jekyll in Windows container for local build
