# Roon and Sonos made easy with Docker

I was an early adopter of digital music, and started amassing a large collection of CDs and ripping them to MP3. Once I had headphones that could hear how much quality was lost, I started over with WMA lossless & FLAC to preserve the full quality of each recording. I can listen at full quality on my good audio systems, or enjoy it throughout the house using Sonos since I stored everything on a big file server.

Lately, I've been enjoying Tidal as a way to listen to all the albums I haven't yet bought in their full quality. Dealing with a huge collection of 1000+ albums plus everything on Tidal is a daunting task. I heard Roon was supposed to be able to handle it, plus help me explore and discover new music.

I dug into it, and found out that it requires a server, along with remote and render apps. I figured I'd give it a try, but wanted something that would be easy to migrate to another server or the cloud later. 

## Parts needed

- [AirSonos](https://medium.com/@stephencwan/hacking-airplay-into-sonos-93a41a1fcfbb) - this is an AirPlay to Sonos bridge. It will make all of your Sonos devices show up on the network as if they were native AirPlay devices. There are some step by step instructions on how to make this work on the [Roon community forum](https://community.roonlabs.com/t/can-i-output-to-sonos-devices/5697/28)
- [Roon Server](https://kb.roonlabs.com/LinuxInstall)


## Setting up AirSonos
- [justintime/airsonos](https://hub.docker.com/r/justintime/airsonos/)


```bash
sudo docker run -d --restart=always --net="host" --name="airsonos" \
  -p 5000-5050:5000-5050/tcp justintime/airsonos
```

Right away, it found all 3 of my Sonos devices:

```none

Once I figured out how to use AirPlay in iOS 10, it worked. My mistake was that the AirPlay button is now for display only. Once something is playing on the phone, swipe up from the bottom then left. 

There's a bit of delay, but hey, it works.

## Setting up Roon Server

- [mikedickey/roonserver](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikedickey/roonserver/) - [Dockerfile on GitHub](https://github.com/mikedickey/RoonServer)
- [ronch/roon-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/ronch/roon-server/) - No link to Dockerfile

I decided to build mikedickey's image myself, rather than pulling it to make sure I had the latest version.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikedickey/RoonServer
cd RoonServer
docker build -t roonserver .
```

His instructions said to run `docker run --name RoonServer --net=host -d -v /home/roon:/var/roon -v /home/music:/music mikedickey/roonserver`, but had a few concerns about it:
1. I don't have my music on the same server as the container, and I want to mount it read-only. I use J.River Media Center for all tagging instead, and don't want any other apps modifying or retagging files.
2. It seems unreasonable to map a whole home directory from the server.


Instead, I want to use a Docker volume to store /var/roon, and map in my existing file server read only.

I created a new user 'roon', and gave it read only permissions to my file share.

On the Linux container host, I followed the steps for [MountWindowsSharesPermanently](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently) to mount my music to /mnt/musicarchive. The user I created on the Windows side only has read only access to the share.

Creating a container volume is easy, just put a unique name after -v for the server side of the path such as `-v roondata:/var/roon`.

This changed my command line to 
`docker run --name RoonServer --net=host -d -v roondata:/var/roon -v /mnt/musicarchive:/music roonserver`


## Setting up Roon on Windows
I'm not going to use my laptop as a server, but I would like to use it for control and output. I downloaded and installed the Windows 64 bit version from the [download site](https://roonlabs.com/downloads.html)

One of the first steps was 
![Choose your Core]({{site.url}}/images/2016-11-13-roon/windows_connect_1.png), which showed the right IP for my Linux server running the container. I chose it, then logged in using my Roon login and password.

It had my Tidal collection there immediately, but didn't have my local collection.

I clicked the hamburger menu, went to Settings, Storage, Watched Folders then clicked "Add Folder". There's a local folder button, so I clicked it and entered `/music/`. 

CPU usage peaked on the server for a bit - `docker stats` showed that the Roon server container was busy indeed:

```


## Things to think about for later
I could probably run all of this in Windows containers and skip the Linux VM altogether. If I decide to keep Roon, I'll probably look into that.

Deploy with Docker-Compose
- Move Roon Server's configuration file out of the container into a container volume
- Build directly from Docker-Compose to make sure it's always up to date
